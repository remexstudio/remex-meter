# Native macOS Widget

This directory contains the WidgetKit extension embedded by the Electron macOS build.

## Configuration

The committed defaults are non-personal placeholders. Ordinary macOS packaging does not include the Widget:

- `npm run pack`
- `npm run dist:mac`
- `npm run dist:mac:x64`

They leave `TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_ENABLED` unset/disabled and therefore do not require Widget artifacts or Widget identifiers. Only the explicit `pack:mac:widget` and `dist:mac:widget*` entries enable the Widget. The official Release workflow selects `dist:mac:widget` and `dist:mac:widget:x64`, so its signed macOS artifacts include the Widget while the ordinary commands remain available as a fallback.

For a local unsigned or ad-hoc preview, use the example identifiers and `TOKEN_MONITOR_LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_SIGNING=1`. This mode does not validate production App Group authorization and must not be used as evidence that a formal distribution build is provisioned. A Team-prefixed App Group instead selects an Apple Development identity automatically, because an ad-hoc host and extension cannot access that App Group; when `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` is also set, its value must match the App Group prefix. Set `TOKEN_MONITOR_MAC_DEVELOPMENT_IDENTITY` only when more than one Apple Development identity is installed.

For a formal Widget distribution, configure all of the following without committing their values:

- `TOKEN_MONITOR_APP_GROUP` — shared App Group used by the Electron app and extension.
- `TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_BUNDLE_ID` — extension bundle identifier.
- `TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_DISTRIBUTION=1` — enables production validation.
- `TOKEN_MONITOR_MAC_DISTRIBUTION_CHANNEL=developer-id` — the only formal distribution channel currently supported.
- `TOKEN_MONITOR_APP_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` — app provisioning profile when the App Group uses the `group.*` form.
- `TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` — extension provisioning profile for the same App Group.
- `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` — Apple Developer Team ID used by Xcode when signing is enabled.
- `TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_KIND` — stable WidgetKit kind shared by the extension and reload helper.

The official Release workflow requires a `group.*` App Group. It reads `TOKEN_MONITOR_APP_GROUP`, `TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_BUNDLE_ID`, `TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_KIND`, and `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` from GitHub Actions repository variables and fails before building when any is missing or the App Group is not `group.*`. Store the main-app and extension profiles as the base64-encoded Actions secrets `TOKEN_MONITOR_APP_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` and `TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`; the workflow decodes them into temporary files and exports the profile paths expected by the build. Team-prefixed App Groups remain supported by manual distribution commands but are not accepted by the official Release workflow. Signing certificates and notarization credentials remain in Actions secrets.

The Widget bundle identifier must be inside the configured Electron app identifier namespace. App Groups must use either the `group.<name>` form or the `<10-character-DEVELOPMENT_TEAM>.<name>` form; the latter requires an explicit matching `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`. A `group.*` App Group requires both provisioning profiles, and those profiles must be non-development Developer ID profiles (`get-task-allow=false`, `ProvisionsAllDevices=true`, and no `ProvisionedDevices`). The build fails before signing when required production values, identifiers, channel, or profiles are invalid.

Do not commit personal values, certificates, provisioning profiles, or private keys. A usable App Group must exist in the selected Apple Developer account and be enabled by both provisioning profiles.

## Build and test

```bash
TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_ARCH=arm64 npm run build:mac-widget
TOKEN_MONITOR_WIDGET_ARCH=x64 npm run build:mac-widget
xcodebuild -project native/macos/TokenMonitorWidget.xcodeproj -scheme TokenMonitorWidget -destination 'platform=macOS' test CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

`npm run build:mac-widget` follows the selected target architecture (`arm64` or `x64` → `x86_64`) and stages an unsigned local Widget preview. Use `npm run pack:mac:widget` once to create the Electron host. During ordinary SwiftUI iteration, deploy into that existing app without rebuilding Electron or vendored tools:

```bash
npm run dev:mac-widget -- --app '/absolute/path/to/Token Monitor.app'
```

The fast path keeps persistent Xcode DerivedData, rebuilds only the arm64 Widget extension, preserves the packaged App Group and Widget bundle identifier, signs with the matching Apple Development identity, verifies that both the host and extension authorize the App Group team, re-registers the host, and relaunches it. The first run may re-sign the full Electron bundle when converting an old ad-hoc app; later runs sign only the changed extension and outer container. Use `dist:mac:widget` / `dist:mac:widget:x64` with production identifiers, profiles where required, and signing credentials for release artifacts. The packaging verifier checks the complete `.app` bundle, exact architectures, identifiers, entitlements, and embedded profiles before release handoff. The release signer signs the extension before the containing Electron app.

WidgetKit schedules timeline refreshes; the 15-minute policy is a request, not a real-time guarantee. The extension keeps displaying the last valid snapshot while the main app is closed and shows explicit missing/stale states.

The extension registers five purpose-built Widgets: Small Summary; Medium Activity, Breakdown, and Quota; and Large Dashboard. Summary, Breakdown, and Dashboard take their period from the Widget configuration, while Activity and Quota use the Today snapshot. There is no in-Widget page or period navigation. Widget content requests a WidgetKit timeline reload from the existing App Group snapshot without opening Token Monitor or forcing a usage/limits collection. Every non-future date cell inside the Medium and Large activity coverage remains an App Intent button, including dates missing from `activity.days[]`; missing dates display `0 tokens`. Snapshot schema v10 is the only supported native Widget contract and carries period snapshots plus privacy-safe masked quota account labels without unreleased migration mirrors.

Activity day selection remains per family and does not alter a Widget instance's configured view or period. Keep that boundary when changing the snapshot or App Group presentation keys.

Each family has its own composition. Small is a glanceable period total with cost and a smooth trend line. Medium provides focused Activity, Quota, or configurable Tools/Models breakdown Widgets. Large is a compact dashboard combining the period total, trend context, quotas, a configurable Tools or Models breakdown, and the activity heatmap. The views use WidgetKit system content margins and Token Monitor's dark blue-black visual system in every appearance.

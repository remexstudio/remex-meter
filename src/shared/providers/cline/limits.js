// Cline limits provider: the ClinePass usage windows, read from the account API
// Cline itself uses. Reached through providerFetchers() in
// src/shared/limits/collector.js.
//
// The endpoint, the field names and the credential variable names are the ones the
// public ClinePass clients already use — CodexBar, CodeBurn and OpenClaude — and the
// ones Cline itself ships: the bundle its dashboard serves carries a generated API
// client for this API, `/users/me/plan/usage-limits`, `/users/{id}/balance`,
// `/users/{id}/usages/daily` and `/users/{id}/usages` among its paths, with a limit
// entry mapping to exactly `{percentUsed, resetsAt, type}`. CodexBar's ClinePass guide
// names the request and the three window types verbatim, so a key configured for one
// of those tools works here unchanged. The guards below are this provider's own
// reading of that contract, and every choice they make where it is unclear is
// recorded in docs/providers/cline.md.
//
// Credentials come from two places, in this order:
//
//   1. `CLINE_API_KEY`, then `CLINEPASS_API_KEY` — behind a `clineApiKey`
//      provider option, which outranks both and is what the settings field
//      supplies. Every implementation named above
//      stops here, which is why they all document ClinePass as key-only.
//   2. The sign-in Cline Desktop and the Cline CLI already persist in
//      `settings/providers.json` under the `~/.cline/data` tree whose
//      `sessions/` directory also supplies this client's token usage. That is
//      the zero-setup path for anyone actually running Cline, and it is the
//      reason this provider can work without the user pasting anything.
//
// Path 2 is read only, which is where Cline's own implementation draws the line:
// its token response may carry a replacement refresh token (`toClineCredentials`
// takes `responseData.refreshToken` when present) and its auth service writes the
// rotated access token, refresh token, expiry and account id back to
// `providers.json` itself (`writeClineCredentials`, on any credential change).
// Refreshing here would mean discarding a replacement token, leaving Cline
// holding one the server has retired. So the stored token is used as-is: Cline
// refreshes it the next time it runs, a token that has expired is refused by the
// account API and reported as `unauthorized` rather than healed here, and nothing
// in this file writes to that credential file.
//
// Cline's per-model free allowance (`cline-free/*`) has no read surface at all:
// its daily cap appears only in the body of the 429 that refuses the call. So the
// plan windows here are the ClinePass subscription's, not the free tier's. What
// the account holds instead of a plan — its pay-as-you-go credit, the "Credits:
// 0.5000" on the account page — is read from `/api/v1/users/{id}/balance` and
// reported as a credits window. That endpoint is keyed by the user id and
// ownership-checked, so it is queried with the id belonging to the credential in
// use: the stored sign-in carries it, while a key-only install learns it from
// `/api/v1/users/me` first, which is one extra request per scan there.

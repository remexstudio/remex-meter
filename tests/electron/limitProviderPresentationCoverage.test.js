// Catalog → limits presentation completeness.
//
// A limits provider renders as a mark through three surfaces: the icon set the
// Limits list picks a mark from, the tray set whose artwork is rasterized and
// handed to the OS, and the CSS mask that paints both. The mark set and the
// masks now derive from the vendor presentation table, and the tray set from
// the catalog, but each still fails
// differently and none of them fails loudly — a missing mark draws a bare dot, a
// missing tray id draws the provider's first letter, and a missing mask rule
// draws a solid square. This file asserts each covers every
// LIMIT_PROVIDER_CATALOG entry, so a provider added without its presentation
// wiring fails CI instead of shipping unmarked.
//
// The direction matters. trayProviderIcons.test.js checks that assets exist, but
// it starts from its own hand-listed tool ids, so a provider that never reached
// that list is invisible to it. Starting from the catalog is what catches the
// entry that reached none of these surfaces.
//
// The row's status pill is the same contract one layer up: a label the list can
// draw has to resolve to copy, and a label missing from the renderer's translation
// map renders as raw English in every non-English locale without failing anything.
// That is asserted here too, from the catalog.
//
// The catalog's other hand-wired presentation surfaces are already guarded from
// the catalog elsewhere and are deliberately not repeated here: the Swift
// widget snapshot's labels and palette in macWidgetProviderLabels.test.js, the README
// tables in readmeConsistency.test.js, and account settings in
// limitProviderCoverage.test.js.

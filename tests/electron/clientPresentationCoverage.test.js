// Every tracked client needs a colour, a vendor label, an ordering slot and a
// row icon before it renders correctly. All four derive from one entry in the
// vendor presentation table (src/shared/vendorPresentation.js), and this file
// asserts each derived surface covers every CLIENT_CATALOG entry, so a client
// added without that entry fails CI instead of shipping as an unlabelled grey
// row.
//
// The direction matters: themePresets.test.js already checks that every
// clientColors brand key has a label and an ordering slot. That starts from the
// colour table. These checks start from the catalog, which is what catches a
// client that never reached the colour table at all.
